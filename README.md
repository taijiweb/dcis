## development

 Dcis will take a development mode different from domcom,  which was completely developed by personal, all of implementation for domcom had been finished before it was released. Dcis will live on the github from the start, and  while the the work is in progeess, I'll report the development history to the community in time, and discuss the issues with the people who are intested with dcis. You are welcome to contribute this project. Thanks in advance!

 dcis将采取不同于domcom的开发模式。domcom完全是个人开发，发布前已经完成所有实现。dcis将从头就作为公开项目放置在github上，随时向社区公布开发进程，和参与者共同讨论所有问题。 欢迎大家参与和提供帮助。在此预先表示感谢！
